# Aadhaar Seva Assistant

**Helping Reach Every Citizen for Better Service Delivery across India**

## Overview

The Aadhaar Seva Assistant is a project designed to help make identity card services better in every district. It finds where people need help and helps managers plan for more centers to reach everyone. The project uses grouping methods, change tracking, and growth plans to help citizens get their services faster and more easily.

## Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to make sure every citizen in India has easy access to enrollment and record fixing services. By looking at district needs, we can help plan where to send mobile vans and where to add more support staff to help people quickly.
